My notes for Master in Computational and Applied Mathematics from Carlos III University.

The notes are for edition 2025-26.

I will probably build them as pdf in GitHub actions soon enough.

The notes are made with Typst, because with LaTeX I think it would be impossible to do in class at speed lol.
