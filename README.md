My notes for Master in Computational and Applied Mathematics from Carlos III University.

The notes are for edition 2025-26. You can get them [here](https://github.com/odilf/masters-notes/releases/latest)

These are provided with no warranty, they might have mistakes or be misleading. If you find an error though, feel free to create an issue in the repository or submit a PR!

The notes are made with Typst, because with LaTeX I think it would be impossible to do in class at speed lol.
